What we have learned…

… about modelling





… about notations

… about the tools

Dislike:

-> Not clear what they do at first sight.
-> Very complicated UI to do simple things.

Archstudio 4: 

Dislike: 

-> Too much right-Click based menus, so everything takes a lot of time and clicks.
-> To set a Connection it needs a lot of clicks. It would be better to select 2 components and the tool makes a connection between them.
-> "DEL" Button should work for removing an element.
-> Unintuitive GUI, it's not clear (without a tutorial) how to use the editors (or which editor to use for what).

Like:

-> Automatic code generation.
-> Gives a good overview of the structure/architecture of the system.
-> Avoids editing XML


… about the properties of the system
