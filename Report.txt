What we have learned…

… about modelling

Is important to communicate an architecture.

Like:
-> Easy to give an overview.



… about notations

Different notations have different strength. E.g. UML emphasizes on providing a good overview, but is ambiguous. xADL is restricted, not as clear but can be used to generate code.

Like:
-> Graphical is better understandable than text, but lacks details. E.g. what distribution algorithm is a Message Queue using?

Dislike:
-> (Visual) grouping of components in xADL not possible. Would make it even clearer to understand at first sight. E.g. grouping of Server, Client and Peer components.

… about the tools

Dislike:

-> Not clear what they do at first sight.
-> Very complicated UI to do simple things.

Archstudio 4: 

Dislike: 

-> Too much right-Click based menus, so everything takes a lot of time and clicks.
-> To set a Connection it needs a lot of clicks. It would be better to select 2 components and the tool makes a connection between them.
-> "DEL" Button should work for removing an element.
-> Unintuitive GUI, it's not clear (without a tutorial) how to use the editors (or which editor to use for what).

Like:

-> Automatic code generation.
-> Gives a good overview of the structure/architecture of the system.
-> Avoids editing XML


… about the properties of the system
